# 2048 Clone

This is a clone of **2048** that I originally built in 2018 while taking the [Rice University Python course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python). The original version was written in Python2.7 and used a text-based interface.

I updated the code to Python3 and added a graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter`. The GUI includes basic tile rendering, score tracking, and a restart button.

### Features
- Classic 2048 gameplay
- Smooth GUI built with `tkinter`
- Score tracking
- Restart button

### How to Run

```bash
python3 2048.py
